<h1>Anomaly Detection in Search Queries with Python</h1>
Anomaly detection in search queries refers to the process of <b>identifying unusual or unexpected patterns in search query data</b>

Search queries represent the queries made by users in a search engine or a database to retrieve specific information. Anomalies in search queries can indicate various issues such as technical glitches, spam attacks, changes in user behavior, or emerging trends.

To perform anomaly detection in search queries , we  can follow these process:

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Gather historical data on search queries. We have Google Search Console data (search queries)
    
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data: Remove any irrelevant or duplicate entries, handle missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning tasks.
   - Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the search query data that may help in detecting anomalies. This could include features such as query frequency, length of queries etc.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of search queries over time.
   - Identify patterns and trends in the data.
   - Visualize the data to gain insights into potential anomalies.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm. Common approaches include statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, moving averages), machine learning models. I have used isolation forests
   - Consider the characteristics of your data and the specific requirements of your use case when selecting a model.

6. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Apply the trained model to detect anomalies in the test data.
   - Generate anomaly scores or labels for each search query.
